## Becoming a Client 
What else am I getting besides face to face sessions?  

Therapy is more than just talking and engaging for a small periods of time per week. After our sessions I complete documentation and research to find specific evidence-based practices that may be beneficial for your healing journey and desired outcomes. I prepare each session but open the atmosphere to whatever it is that you need during the 50 minute session. Part of a therapist's position is staying up to date with therapeutic techniques and gaining knowledge that enhances the delivery of authentic treatment plans suitable for your unique needs, struggles, strengths, values, and beliefs. 

## Covid-19
Due to the pandemic my services are offered completely from online formats that follow ethical guidelines and are highly confidential, ensuring your safety and privacy. Two popular avenues include scheduled online video conferences and phone calls.
