## Becoming a Client 
What else am I getting besides face to face sessions?  

Therapy is more than just talking and engaging for a small periods of time per week. After our sessions I complete documentation and research to find specific evidence-based practices that may be beneficial for your healing journey and desired outcomes. I prepare each session but open the atmosphere to whatever it is that you need during the 50 minute session. Part of a therapist's position is staying up to date with therapeutic techniques and gaining knowledge that enhances the delivery of authentic treatment plans suitable for your unique needs, struggles, strengths, values, and beliefs.
