I have worked in the mental health field for the last eight years and throughout many diversities/personal experiences my career development has allowed me to develop into the practitioner I am today. I stay true to my genuine and unconditionally supportive values, which  center around: 
 - automonmy 
 - authenticity 
 - growth 
 - passion 
 - empathy

I hold a safe space for those who are ready to understand and explore themselves .
