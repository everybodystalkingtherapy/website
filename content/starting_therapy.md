There are over 500 styles of therapy, which can be overwhelming to think about when starting to focus on your mental health. Together, we will evaluate the right therapy approach for you! We work collaboratively in a conversation-like fashion to identify and heal specific behaviours and experiences that are causing challenges for you. Typically, we work in all three time frames, past, present, and future. Depending on your comfort level, we do not always need to discuss the past; you control your therapy process and outcomes.

During our first connection, we have a brief consultation over the phone to ensure our psychotherapist is a good fit for you, and we schedule our first virtual appointment. You will then receive an email with an intake form, and this document outlines what psychotherapy is and what it isn’t.

The first session is usually the most uncomfortable, and your clinician aims to ensure the environment is warm and welcoming. With open communication, you and your therapist map out your therapy steps, they help prompt you if needed, and you both get to know each other! We develop what is known as a “therapeutic alliance,” which is a professional relationship that enhances your therapy experience. We value extending a  secure and safe connection and recognize the importance of your therapist being a good fit for your needs.

Sessions typically last for 50 minutes, and the final 10 minutes are utilized by your therapist for documentation, sharing resources, and completing research on therapy approaches. The length of therapy may vary depending on your needs, we offer both short-term or long-term approaches. Once we have collaborated on your primary focus and goals, we continue through the therapy process in which your therapist subtly intertwines the therapy approach within your discussions—allowing the sessions to flow uniquely, reflecting and reassuring your strengths and skills so that you can manage and grow through struggling experiences with coping strategies and new ways of living.
