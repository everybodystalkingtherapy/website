Who I am isn’t as important as what I can offer you – nonjudgmentally, I have worked in the mental health field for the last eight years and throughout many diversities/personal experiences my career development has allowed me to develop into the practitioner I am today. I stay true to my genuine and unconditionally supportive values, with a belief that everybody is somebody; especially those who haven’t been understood or heard. I hold a safe space for those who are ready to understand themselves and put forth the effort to unravel the doubt you may -- not at all what I want to say but close for now
