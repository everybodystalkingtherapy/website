These are a few helpful resources I often recommend: 

- The [Upward Spiral by Alex Korb, PhD](https://www.amazon.ca/Upward-Spiral-Neuroscience-Reverse-Depression/dp/1626251207/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?adgrpid=127566796921&gclid=Cj0KCQiAyracBhDoARIsACGFcS7DjpkKXwZzLJQd3vH9hfrXNlTopRJQcncxBzqFUqLahMrNjY2OiCUaAvv1EALw_wcB&hvadid=605879893385&hvdev=m&hvlocphy=9000876&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=12974017738614520971&hvtargid=kwd-299904176334&hydadcr=516_1015042872&keywords=the+upward+spiral&qid=1670283765&sr=8-1) is great for those who notice themselves spiralling down or are diagnosed with depression (I find the information to be universal ðŸ˜Š)
- [First, We Make the Beast Beautiful: A New Journey Through Anxiety](https://www.amazon.ca/First-We-Make-Beast-Beautiful/dp/0062836781/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?crid=37ENTL1PKU3WA&keywords=first+we+make+the+beast+beautiful&qid=1670283908&sprefix=but+first+we+make+the+beast+%2Caps%2C89&sr=8-1), by Sarah Wilson explains the beauty of accepting certain parts of ourselves, specifically focusing on anxiety 
- Building a [gratitude list](https://www.google.ca/search?q=gratitude+list) â€” sometimes shifting our perspective to the positive uplifts our spirits, itâ€™s simple and effective!! There is a lot of evidence based research describing the benefits of using gratitude as a mood booster!!

There are also many helpful Instagram profiles, YouTube videos, and podcasts that are relatable and educational when it comes to psychology and mental health :) a few of my favourites are: [Therapy in a Nutshell](https://www.youtube.com/c/TherapyinaNutshell), [Kati Morton](https://www.youtube.com/@Katimorton), [@notyouraveragetherapst](https://www.instagram.com/notyouraveragethrpst/?hl=en), [@amoderntherapist](https://www.instagram.com/amoderntherapist/?hl=en), [@mastinkipp](https://www.instagram.com/mastinkipp/?hl=en)
