blurb: "There is an ingrained level of resiliency within us. We are biologically wired to keep surviving through the toughest possibilities life may throw our way. Often these experiences cause us to feel as if we are broken, weak, and in need of fixing. We often bottle up our emotions and inner voice with fear of being judged, discriminated, or shamed.


**Our emotions are valid**. 


We all hurt and are in need of healing; in need of talking about it, releasing it, acknowledging and accepting it— that’s human nature! 
If you’re here, visiting this site, you’re probably getting ready to seek support through moments of struggle and ready to change your current ways of thinking, feeling, and being. **What strength!**"
