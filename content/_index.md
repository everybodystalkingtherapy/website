blurb: "As humans, we experience unique and varying struggles but are unsure how to manage life with fulfilled stability. Opening up about these struggles can feel overwhelming and awkward, or we may feel like we are “dumping” on those around us. Having a therapist to supportively listen, empathize, and constructively help guide your mental health plan can make the journey of healing with resiliency and self-compassion lighter and less isolating. 

##  

Everybody’s Talking aims to reflect, understand, support, and educate individuals across Ontario and the Hamilton/Halton community. Within the safe space we extend during our sessions, we stay inclusive, nonjudgemental, flexible, and genuinely extend unconditional positive regard. We walk beside you and relate with your emotional self, explore your inner world, and collaboratively develop coping strategies suitable for your needs. There is no linear way through therapy, and there is no “right” way either; there are multiple ways so that everyone can be included."
