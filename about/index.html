Over the past nine years, she has worked in mental health and addictions, furthering her career development in psychotherapy since 2018. Her theoretical practices are integratively grounded in trauma-informed care, humanistic, existential, psychodynamic, person-centered, biopsychosocial, and attachment theories. She incorporates technical elements eclectically to suit the needs of her clients; a few examples of therapy modalities she practices include:</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapy-types/acceptance-and-commitment-therapy>Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/hope-eating-disorder-recovery/201609/what-is-dbt>Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)</a></li><li><a href=https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-author-speaks/202109/primer-emotionally-focused-individual-therapy>Emotionally Focused Individual Therapy (EFIT)</a></li><li><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapy-types/rational-emotive-behavior-therapy#:~:text=Rational%20Emotive%20Behavior%20Therapy%20is,with%20healthier%2C%20more%20productive%20beliefs">Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy (REBT)</a></li></ul><p>Emma has a passion for neuropsychology and the development of personalities over the life span. Her career development has provided her with opportunities working with Medical Psychotherapy, Brock University, and involvement with Chrysalis Institute. She aims to continue her education in trauma-informed care and enhance her clinician skills by researching up-to-date, evidence-based practices. She hopes to educate the community through future group programs and volunteering with organizations in the Hamilton/Halton area.</p><p>On a personal note, I engage therapy techniques in my life with you and employ self-care activities throughout my week to ensure I am compassionate and attentive each time we connect. I have a strong belief that our relationships shape and influence our mental health, including the client-therapist relationship. During my time away from the office, I socialize with friends and family, hike, travel, snowboard, play sports, complete DIY projects, and research astrology and sociology.</p><div style=text-align:center><img src=https://www.everybodystalkingtherapy.ca/logo.jpg width=612 height=450></div></div></div></div></article></main><footer><div class="justify-content-center pb-3 row text-center"><div class="col text-muted" style=max-width:100ch>Â© Emma Fackelmann</div></div></footer></div><script crossorigin=anonymous integrity=sha384-A3rJD856KowSb7dwlZdYEkO39Gagi7vIsF0jrRAoQmDKKtQBHUuLZ9AsSv4jD4Xa src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.2.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js></script></body></html>
