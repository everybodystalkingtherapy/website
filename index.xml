I stay true to my genuine and unconditionally supportive values, with a belief that everybody is somebody; especially those who haven’t been understood or heard. I hold a safe space for those who are ready to understand themselves and put forth the effort to unravel the doubt you may &amp;ndash; not at all what I want to say but close for now&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Booking and Fees</title><link>http://example.org/page/bookingandfees/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/page/bookingandfees/</guid><description>&lt;p>Booking and Fees&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
